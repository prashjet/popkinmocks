Welcome to popkinmocks's documentation!
=======================================

`popkinmocks` is a toolkit to create models of stellar population and kinematic distributions of galaxies and produce mock Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations. You can specify model distributions either (i) using a library of parameterised functions of the morphology, kinematics, star formation histories, and chemical enrichments of galactic components, or (ii) using particle-data from simulations. Once you specify a model distribution, `popkinmocks` provides tools to evaluate:

- marginal or conditional projections,
- moments,
- mass-weighted or light-weighted quantities,
- IFU datacubes.
